Hilly Fields Technical College
==============================
![Logo](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-ogm/blob/master/neo4j-spring-examples/sdn-boot/src/main/webapp/assets/images/engineering-dept.JPG)

This project is a demo application for the [Spring Data Neo4j 4.1](https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-data-neo4j)
library which provides convenient access to the [Neo4j](http://neo4j.org) graph database.

This tutorial is a fully functioning micro-service based web-application built using the following components

- Spring Boot 1.4
- Spring Data Neo4j 4.1
- Angular.js
- Twitter Bootstrap UI
- Swagger UI

The application's domain is a fictitious educational institution: Hilly Fields Technical College. The application allows you to manage the College's Departments, Teaching Staff, Subjects, Students and Classes.

It leverages the power of Spring Data Neo4j/Spring Boot and in particular the new Neo4j Object Graph mapping technology to provide a RESTful interface with which the web client interacts. The application is entirely stateless: every interaction involves a call to a Neo4j server, hopefully demonstrating the speed of the new technology, even over the wire.

WARNING
-------
By default, the application will attempt to use a Neo4j instance running on the same machine as the application server, and on the standard port 7474. *IT WILL DESTROY ALL THE DATA IN THAT DATABASE AT STARTUP*. So if you don't want that to happen please back up any existing database first.

Spring Boot Configuration
-------------------------
SDN4-University uses the spring-boot-starter for SDN, available in Spring Boot 1.4 and later versions.
 
The starter will auto-configure the application from the `application.properties` file in the `config` directory. 

Connecting to a remote server over Http
---------------------------------------
    # application.properties
    
    # set the connection uri for the Neo4j server
    spring.data.neo4j.uri=http://neo4j:password@localhost:7474
    # neo4j session scoped to the web session
    spring.data.neo4j.session.scope=session
    
Connecting to an embedded Neo4j instance
---------------------------------------
    # application.properties
    
    # set the connection uri to a directory on the local filesystem, or leave it blank to use an in-memory instance
    spring.data.neo4j.uri=file:///tmp/sdn-university
    # neo4j session scoped to the web session
    spring.data.neo4j.session.scope=session

To use the Embedded Driver you must also uncomment its dependency declaration in the pom:

        <!-- uncomment this dependency to use the embedded driver
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.neo4j</groupId>
            <artifactId>neo4j-ogm-embedded-driver</artifactId>
            <version>${ogm.driver.version}</version>
        </dependency>
        -->
        
    
Application Configuration
-------------------------

Application Configuration is very simple:

```
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableTransactionManagement
@EnableNeo4jRepositories(basePackages = "school.domain")
public class Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new SpringApplication(Application.class).run(args);
    }

}
```

> Note the annotation `@EnableNeo4jRepositories`. This defines the packages that contain your application's domain classes. It is used by Spring Boot to configure the Neo4j OGM SessionFactory, so there is no need to explicitly manage this yourself. 

Start Neo4j
-----------

Now start your Neo4j server instance, if its not already running. 

**You should back up any data you want to keep because the application will purge any existing data first**

Starting the application
------------------------

    cd neo4j-spring-examples/sdn4-university
    mvn spring-boot:run

Packaging the application
-------------------------
You can also run the application from a packaged war or jar file. The default packaging is `war` in the pom file, 
change this to `jar` if you want to package the application as a jar file.

To create a packaged application:

    cd neo4j-spring-examples/sdn4-university
    mvn clean package
    
And then to run it:
    
    java -jar target/sdn4-university-0.2.0.war

Authentication
--------------
The application itself does not require any authentication, but if you are running against Neo4j 2.2 or later,
you'll need to provide connection credentials for the database. 

These can be specified in `application.properties` located in  `config`. You can embed the credentials in the URI string, for example: 

    spring.data.neo4j.URI=http://bilbo:baggins@localhost:7474 

or you can supply them as distinct properties:

    spring.data.neo4j.username=bilbo
    spring.data.neo4j.password=baggins

Loading the initial dataset
---------------------------
The application can load a set of base data, to get you started. Please be aware that this will destroy
any existing data that may previously exist, so take a backup.

    http://localhost:8080/api/reload

This will pre-load the Neo4j database with a handful of departments, a dozen or so subjects and teachers,
and 200 students. You'll probably want to enrol them in classes...

Exploring the API:
-----------------
The JSON resources from the server can be inspected from the /api/... URLs, e.g.

    http://localhost:8080/api/departments/
    http://localhost:8080/api/subjects/
    http://localhost:8080/api/teachers/
    http://localhost:8080/api/students/
    http://localhost:8080/api/classes/
    
By SwaggerUI:

    http://localhost:8080/static/index.html

Running the Hilly Fields web application
----------------------------------------
Simply point your browser at the root URL:

    http://localhost:8080

Stopping the application server
-------------------------------
You can stop the application server at any time by pressing Ctrl-C in the console window from where you launched it.

Make it better!
---------------
If you'd like to develop this application further, you will need to install node.js if it is not already installed:

- Node.js v0.10x+
- npm (which comes bundled with Node) v2.1.0+

Visit the node.js website for details of installing node.js for your particular operating system.

Once node is installed you'll then need to grab the following npm packages:

    npm install --global bower grunt-cli
